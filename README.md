# ALterLife

AlterLife is a story about two friends who end up in the universe with their own volition and end up getting sucked in a blackhole.

The blackhole leads them to an alternate world with FLAT EARTH! When they land, to their surprise, they accidently meet their alternate selves.

The story is open-ended leaving the readers to fill in the future with their imagination (or wait for the next installment to find out what happens to the two friends ;))

The theme of the story is openness - almost all the panels are without a frame, symbolizing the nature of the universe â€“ infinite space and time.

The comic is supposed to be immersive; build with the hope of taking the readers on an interstellar adventure.

For implementing the concept we used multiple animation techniques utilising CSS and various JavaScript libraries. These techniques depend on user scrolling leading to various panels aligned vertically as well as hovering over an image to get the sense of what's actually happening.

The final version is pretty close to what we imagined in the beginning. A few things took longer than expected while some needed fine-tuning. However, apart from that, we managed to implement everything we decided on our first meeting. It was a tough process though that made us learn so many new things.
