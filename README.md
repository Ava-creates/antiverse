# ALterLife

AlterLife is a story about two friends who end up in the universe with their own volition and end up getting sucked in a blackhole.

The blackhole leads them to an alternate world with FLAT EARTH! There meet their alternate selves. 

The story is open ended leaving the reader to fill in the future with their imagination( or wait for the next installment to find out what happens to these two friends ;) )

The theme of the story is openess - almost all the panels are without a frame, signifying infinite space and time 

The comic is supposed to be immersive; build with the hope of taking the readers on an Interstellar adventure.

For implementing the concept we used multiple animation techniques utilising css and various javascript libraries. These techniques depend on user scrolling leading to various panels aligned vertically.

The final version is pretty close to what we imagined when beginning. Somethings took longer than expected and some need fine tuning. But apart from that we managed to implenet everything we decided on our first meeting. It was a tough process though that made us learn so many new things.
